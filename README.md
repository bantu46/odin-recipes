This project will demonstrate the objectives I have learned so far from TOP. 
I will make a simple recipe website that will illustrate the learning objectives I have covered so far from The Odin Project. 
This will include:
    1. Setting up a html boiler-plate
    2. Using the correct html semantics and syntax
    3. Organizing my code
    4. Using the correct html elements learned so far
